## **Steps involved in construction of the model are as follows:** ##

**1)Fake-News Dataset:**
Dataset is collected from Caggle: 
* Each news article has unique id

* Each news has its ows title

* Each news has text which might be wrong

* Each news has author

* Each news has label which make news whether it is true or false.
